1,Jofert,"  Like iphone 11,12 now 13. All same look and minor differences. Why Apple fellows release phone with no new features"
2,Vempati Harish Chakravarthi,"  There are a bunch of reviews on the product already. Just sharing my 1st day experience so far, I loved it. This is a major upgrade for me, I jumped from iPhone 7 to 13mini after 4 years. Always wanted to smaller iPhone and looks like so far 13mini is by far the best predecessor of iPhone 7( for me interns of size vs performance ratio). Fantastic Camera, better battery life, and incredibly light phone. All the faults from iPhone 12mini are addressed in this phone. This will be a model which I can hold for at-least next three years in my opinion."
3,Nitin Verma,  Same as previous model iPhone 12 with smaller notch. Don't understand why price is high .Waste of money .
4,Brajesh Bharti,"  I would suggest 12 Pro over 13 mini. Just a suggestion, I regret now and don't want you to fall for this trick of 13. Hard earned money should be well used. I don't see much difference between 12 Pro and 13 Mini with respect to Software and Hardware Upgrade, but we can see a high spike in cost of 13 Series.Suggestion to Apple, it would be far better to grow Real Apple then to sell out such a product to Consumers. I trust Apple would think over my suggestion and bring out some idea to grow Real Apple. Thanks in advance APPLE."
5,Ishaan Aditya,"  I've been using the iPhone 13 mini for more than a week now. This being the last 'mini' iPhone (for now) is rather sad.First things first, this phone is not for everyone. If you're thinking of buying this phone just because it's cheaper than other variants, don't. Save your money, let it grow, buy a different variant. This phone is for a very specific category of the population: ones who enjoy the in-hand feel of small phones.I shall try to summarise my experience with this phone in a simple pros and cons list.Pros:1. Great display - the refresh rate is 60Hz, but even then, this does not feel sluggish. Honestly, you can't even tell the difference if you don't compare it with a display with faster refresh rate. The smaller screen looks sharp and is pretty bright even outdoors. If you still do not like the slow refresh rate, you can always turn off the screen animations.2. So lightweight - For those who have grown sick of large phones, this is a godsend. It's funny how even a few years back, a 5 inch screen was considered huge, and featured only in 'phablets', yet now we have a 5.4 inch display on a Mini device. The phone is pretty light, very easy to hold and operate with one hand and this reduces the risk of dropping the phone.3. Brilliant cameras - The iPhone 13 mini used the same camera systems as last year's 12 pro max. It lacks a Lidar scanner and a telephoto lens, but to be honest, you don't really feel the need for it in everday life. The cameras capture enough light, night photos are great, stabilization is great. What more could you want?There is the new cinematic mode and the photographic styles, but those seem to be like nice little add-ons, not a major feature. Not for everyday use anyway.4. Same features as the regular iPhone 13, just in a smaller size. Extremely smooth, no lags when shifting between apps or when opening an app. Good LTE connectivity (Vi and JIO). Very loud speakers.Cons:1. Battery - The battery backup is not bad. The ios optimization sees to it that you get enough battery for 1 full day of use. However, please note, certain apps drain a lot of battery. In general, I have noticed that media apps like youtube, netflix etc tend to drain lesser battery than social media apps such as fb, whatsapp, and even chrome browser.Your work days will last fine, but if you're at home and constantly on call or using WhatsApp, you will need to charge your phone again by evening.2. No charger - Apple says it is to reduce waste and use lesser resources by reducing the packaging , but frankly that is just nonsense. If Apple was so concerned about the environmental impact, it would also have shifted to Type-C ports on the iPhone, or have added a Type A to lightning cable in the box instead of the type C-lightning cable. Which it hasn't, so clearly, it is nothing but a money making scheme by charging extra for chargers, which android manufactures like samsung and xiaomi are also now emulating.For other features and in-depth review, go to YouTube.Bottomline:Great phone for people who prefer lighter phones with all the premium features. Great cameras. Decent battery. I quite like the pink colour. It looks very elegant.For those who like small phones and are used to ios: go for it.For those who want this as their first iphone / looking to buy this as it is cheaper than the rest: Go to a physical store and check the size for yourself. Hold it and compare it to the regular sized iPhone. Only then will you understand if this one is for you.If you're a gamer: don't buy this phone. This is not meant for gamers. You will not enjoy gaming on a smaller display, and neither will the battery hold up, even though the a15 bionic is a beast and can run any and every game.Also, I see some other reviewers leaving certain bogus comments:1. That the display is too small and should have been 6 inches. I mean really? Then why did you even buy the mini? You know there's a regular sized variant too right?2. That there is no difference between iphone 11, 12 and 13 - maybe (although not true at all. There are noticeable differences for people who are seriously considering buying any of these devices, more specifically on the cameras and battery life department), but who is forcing you to upgrade every year, dude? Just get any one variant and then use it for 3-4 years! (Even Apple supports its devices for 5/6 years now).3. That there is no charger hence it is a scam and everyone should boycott - I mean, unless you've been living under a rock or something you should be knowing that Apple is not providing chargers since last year. Although it is not an ideal situation, there's nothing to be so surprised about. Even Samsung and Xiaomi are doing the same with their flagship devices.4. There's nothing new - well unless you're in the business of using smartphone tech to hunt unicorns, I don't understand what 'new' do you expect from a mini device. Don't like it, don't buy it. There are enough choices in the market.5. iPhone 13 mini is the same as iPhone 4 - Bro, are you high?Ridiculous!"
6,Joshuaa Anand ,"  Writing from 'iPhone xs max' I dint see a REAL WORLD improvement to upgrade from my phone till date. Its all about the extra camera and the camera placement. I am still in a Three year old phone which works smooth as butter, which no android does.Sticking to iPhone only for the OS"
7,Arvind,  Apple’s another generation phone with nothing new. Repeating the same set of features for last 3 years. Honestly Apple’s downfall has started. Their business is coming to an end soon. They could have waited for another year for new release. Iphone 13 series was not needed at at ll.
